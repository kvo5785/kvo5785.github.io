### CPSC 120


* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part 1 was my favorite: I enjoyed the lab for various reasons but I think the most enjoyable part of this lab was how it challenged me to grow as a student. Prior to this lab I was always able to rely on my previous experiences but in lab 5 I was forced to step outside my comfort zone. In terms of content I enjoyed the lab's application to everyday life. 

* Lab 7 

    Lab 7: I chose lab number 7 as one of my favorites for two main reasons, the application and the procedure. Lab 7's application was something that I found very interesting because it was an issue that I was dealing with prior to the lab, as my current apartment complex has a major issue with parking. The procedure for the lab was also a new concept for me. This made it all the more rewarding when I the code finally compile. 

* Lab 12 

    Lab 12: Lab 12 was my favorite lab of all as it was a the culmination of all the work we had done in previous labs. I felt like everything was finally clicking and I was beginning to understand computer science for the first time since we started. It was also the closest we got to outputting an image.
